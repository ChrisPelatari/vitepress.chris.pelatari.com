You cna find us on the web at Velocity Databank, Inc.  . Of course, the site is written completely in ASP.NET, with only one little widget that I had to use interop in for the sake of brevity - you know, time constraints and such. I'm 22, live in Houston, TX, and I've been programming in C# since the public beta release of .NET. Personally, I was more than happy to pick it up - but before then I was doing C++ and using the Java SDK a little bit, but not for as long as some of these other bloggers out here. Before that, I really liked web development - but just DHTML, no fancy server-side stuff 'til ASP.NET came along. Basically, I just didn't - and still don't - like the idea of coding in VB...that's right - I said it - No VB for me! HA!

This regular expression works. Almost. I could not figure out why I could add an empty string or a bunch of spaces and it validates as true. So I took a look at the WebUIValidation.js that the validators use.\n\n`function RegularExpressionValidatorEvaluateIsValid(val) {\n  var value = ValidatorGetValue(val.controltovalidate);\n  if (ValidatorTrim(value).length == 0)\n    return true;\n  var rx = new RegExp(val.validationexpression);\n  var matches = rx.exec(value);\n  return (matches != null && value == matches[0]);\n}`\n\nThe important bit is the if(ValidatorTrim) part.

I not only got to work out the problem in a different way than I would have alone, but I also got some great perspective from others before I go and make a decision. After I got to step away from the problem, I decided that my initial gripe may have a silver lining. Here's what I mean:\n\nFirst, let's put ourselves in the user's position. The user in this case will most likely be a Geophysicist that could talk you into a hole about Checkshot velocities, wavelets, etc, but has limited useage of the internet or web applications. I want the user to feel like she has complete control over the data that they can manipulate, but at the same time, I want that data to be valid. Personally, I think it would be counter intuitive to have a 'delete value' button by every textbox (and there are a lot of them), so if I were the user and I wanted to get rid of a previous value, would I automatically think, \"Oh, gee, this started off as N/A - I better change it back.\"? No. No I'm not. I'm gonna highlight whatever I typed in before, hit backspace, and click the update button. That's what I'm used to, and I fear change.:S\n\nI guess my initial gripe was simply the fact that the Regular Expression Validator does not validate the Regex strictly. It validates the Regex and an empty string. Does this make sense to anyone else? If I want to validate something as (\\d{1}), I'm looking for something b/t 0 and 9, not something b/t 0 and 9 OR oh yeah, an empty string will work, too.

Well, the short answer is messing with it. Sometimes the resources that you need when debugging are locked up by a worker process that still thinks it's debugging - so Kill it!

The class has a bunch of static properties that return the correct index of the image based on the loaded ImageList. (Like Images.Forward or Images.Undo)\nI also added a static property to return the internal ImageList incase I want to use it in one of my Forms without calling the individual properties.\nThe trick is to load the bitmap strip in a static constructor - it's always  called first. If I want to add an individual image to a form, I can either create a local ImageList and set it to Images.ImageList or simply set the image of the control I'm targeting to say Images.Back. I have to admit, I usually add the image in (gasp) the InitializeComponent() call - but here's the nice part: since I'm calling a completely static class, the designer can get to the images and loads it not only to the designer surface but also (usually) replaces my Images.Back call with an appropriate call to the ResourceManager to grab the image from its new home - my Form's .resx file.\nGood luck, Marc."},{"layout":"post","title":"added emoticons :)","slug":"2003-09-10-added-emoticons","body":"I've recently added emoticons 😘 to my .Text blog.

It\nwas awesome! What a perfect father's day gift - being able to actually spend (at\nleast) some of it with my son. He even \"got me a card\". See, he's 2 1/2 so it\nwas my mom that really got the card, but she helped him sign it and he drew some\ncircles in it for me. :)\n\nThere were a couple of times that he cried for his mother, but we got thru\nthose and it was only when he was expecting something out of his normal routine.\nAll in all, I would say that he did an excellent job considering this was the\nfirst time that he ever spent the night with me, away from his mother.\n\nI could sit here and go on and on about the details of our weekend, but let's\njust leave this at it was one of the greatest experiences I've had with him\never.

I\nstarted on a subset of an application that I'm working on, using it for the\ndatabase interaction code. I figured that would be a good place to start, since\nI'm not sure how to test UI stuff, and these were the parts handed to me when\nthe application was in spec stage.\nI took a pretty simplistic (and probably wrong by some accounts) approach -\nset up a database with the same structure as what would be used in the end\n(appended with NUnit to separate the DBs) and make my assertions on the objects\nreturned or modified there.\nSo, at the suggestion of someone who digs DataGrids, I\npicked up the TDD in MSFT.NET book by Newkirk &amp;Vorontsov. I just barely\ncracked chapter 2 and came across something that I did not know and did not\noccur to me thru running my tests (with my apologies):\n\n  The function Init is marked with an attribute called\n  [SetUp]. NUnit uses this attribute to ensure that this method is\n  called prior to each test being run, which means that each test method gets a\n  newly created Stack, instead of one modified from a previous\ntest.\nSeriously? I just figured that [SetUp] ran once, so all I\ndid was initialize my connection string there.

So I tried it out. I downloaded the\ncode and applied something very similar to the Office example shown in the\narticle using Tim Dawson's awesome Sandbar  library.\n\nThere was a problem, though. By virtue of a vertical scrollbar, enabled,\ndisabled, visible, or invisible, it always showed up in a space where I need\nthose 23 pixels. It's important. I wanted to take the code that was in the\nexample download and make sure I could remove the scrollbar without breaking\nthings. Well, the way that the code is set up now, you've got to have a Frame\nclass to associate with each Page class. Period.\n\nAt first I tried subclassing the Frame class, but the VS.NET designer did not\nlike that too much. We want to play nice with the designer always, right? Sure\nwe do. (If you don't think so about asp.net, you will soon I'm sure:) What was\nmissing from this puzzle? Looking at the Frame class a little bit further, it\nbecame obvious: this code is begging for an interface implementation. Just\ntaking the public methods that were exposed in the Frame class, I came up with\nthe IFrame interface:\n\npublic interface IFrame\t{\n\t\n\tvoid Go(Page page);\n\n\tvoid Go(Type pageType);\n\n\tvoid GoBack();\n\n\tvoid GoBack(int n);\n\n\tvoid GoForward();\n\n\tvoid GoForward(int n);\n\n\tvoid GoHome();\n\n\tvoid PageDown();\n\n\tvoid PageEnd();\n\n\tvoid PageHome();\n\n\tvoid PageUp();\n}\n\nThen I changed the Page class's reference to its parent frame to hold an\nIFrame reference:\n\npublic IFrame Frame{\n\t\tget{ return frame;}//of course, the private reference is also IFrame\n\t\tset{ frame = value;}\n}\n\nBam. That's it. I then created a class that I called StaticFrame and removed\nthe horizontal and vertical scrollbars from it, implementing only those methods\ndefined in the interface and those required to maintain NavigationContext. Now\nI've got a great navigation story for a sidebar/taskpane type interface in my\napplications."},{"layout":"post","title":"CodeSnip: Getting Currently Playing info from Windows Media Player using the blogging power toy.","slug":"2004-09-23-CodeSnip-Getting-Currently-Playing-info-from-Windows-Media-Player-using-the-blogging-power-toy","body":"I don't know whom this would benefit but someone building a blog posting tool\nfor the desktop, but anyway here's the code that I converted from the jscript\nexample that comes with the Windows Media Player blogging\npowertoy :\n\nusing System;\nusing Microsoft.Win32;\n\npublic class MediaPlayerInfo\n\t{\n\n\t\tpublic static string GetCurrentlyPlayingMedia(){\n\t\t\tRegistryKey regKey = Registry.CurrentUser;\n\t\t\tregKey = regKey.OpenSubKey(\"Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\MediaPlayer\\\\CurrentMetadata\");\n\n\t\t\tstring displayString = \"&lt;div class='media'&gt;[ Currently Listening to: \";\n\n\t\t\tbool hasMetadata = false;\n\n\t\t\tstring trackInfo = \"\";\n\n\t\t\ttry{\n\t\t\t\ttrackInfo = regKey.GetValue(\"Title\").ToString();\n\n\t\t\t\tif(trackInfo.Length != 0){\n\t\t\t\t\thasMetadata = true;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tdisplayString += trackInfo + \" \";\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}catch{\n\t\t\t\ttry{\n\t\t\t\t\ttrackInfo = \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\ttrackInfo = regKey.GetValue(\"Name\").ToString();\n\n\t\t\t\t\tif(trackInfo.Length != 0){\n\t\t\t\t\t\thasMetadata = true;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdisplayString += trackInfo + \" \";\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}catch{}\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\ttry{\n\t\t\t\ttrackInfo = \"\";\n\t\t\t\ttrackInfo = regKey.GetValue(\"DurationString\").ToString();\n\n\t\t\t\tif(trackInfo.Length != 0){\n\t\t\t\t\thasMetadata = true;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tdisplayString += \"(\" + trackInfo + \")\";\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}catch{}\n\n\t\t\ttry{\n\t\t\t\ttrackInfo = \"\";\n\t\t\t\ttrackInfo = regKey.GetValue(\"Author\").ToString();\n\n\t\t\t\tif(trackInfo.Length != 0){\n\t\t\t\t\thasMetadata = true;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tdisplayString += \" by \" + trackInfo;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}catch {}\n\n\t\t\ttry{\n\t\t\t\ttrackInfo = \"\";\n\t\t\t\ttrackInfo = regKey.GetValue(\"Album\").ToString();\n\n\t\t\t\tif(trackInfo.Length != 0){\n\t\t\t\t\thasMetadata = true;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tdisplayString += \" on the album \" + trackInfo;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}catch{}\n\n\n\t\t\tif(!hasMetadata){\n\t\t\t\tdisplayString += \"Nothing.\";\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tdisplayString += \" ]&lt;/div&gt;\";\n\n\t\t\treturn displayString;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\nIt could probably stand to be a bit more flexible - ie user-defined by a\ntemplate like w.bloggar, but for the basics it works great!

(the configurationPath property was\nchanged a bit to enable more than one file to go into that particular path).\n\nThen I added a button next to each option in the config dialog that says\nsimply \"Customize...\". Pressing this button opens a modal form that loads up the\ntext from the user-defined file if it exists, else from the resource\nstream.:\n\n  1 \t\tstring transformPath;\n  2\n  3 \t\tpublic CustomizeForm()\n  4 \t\t{\n  5 \t\t\t//\n  6 \t\t\t// Required for Windows Form Designer support\n  7 \t\t\t//\n  8 \t\t\tInitializeComponent();\n  9\n 10 \t\t}\n 11\n 12 \t\tpublic CustomizeForm(string TransformToCustomize) : this(){\n 13 \t\t\ttransformPath = Path.Combine(BlogThisUsingPostXINGPlugin.ConfigurationPath, string.Format(\"{0}.xslt\", TransformToCustomize));\n 14\n 15 \t\t\tthis.LoadTransform(TransformToCustomize);\n 16 \t\t}\t\n 17\n 18 \t\tprivate void LoadTransform(string TransformToCustomize){\t\t\t\n 19 \t\t\tstring resourceName = string.Format(\"PostXING.Rss.BlogExtensions.Resources.{0}.xslt\", TransformToCustomize);\n 20 \t\t\t//Stream resourceStream;\n 21 \t\t\tStreamReader sr;\n 22\n 23 \t\t\tif(File.Exists(transformPath)){\n 24 \t\t\t\tsr = new StreamReader(transformPath);\n 25 \t\t\t\tthis.rtbTransform.Text = sr.ReadToEnd();\n 26 \t\t\t\tsr.Close();\n 27\n 28 \t\t\t}else{\n 29 \t\t\t\tsr = new StreamReader(ResourceStream(resourceName));\n 30 \t\t\t\tthis.rtbTransform.Text = sr.ReadToEnd();\n 31 \t\t\t\tsr.Close();\n 32\n 33 \t\t\t}\n 34 \t\t}\n 35\n 36 \t\tStream ResourceStream(string resourceName){\n 37 \t\t\treturn Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream(resourceName);\n 38 \t\t}\n\n3 buttons were added to the form: Revert to Original, Apply, and Cancel. I\ndidn't really think that I needed DialogResults, since you have to invoke the\nplugin via its menu every time you want to use it. Revert to Original just\ndeletes the user-defined file. Cancel simply closes the form and does nothing.\nApply does this:\n\n  1 \t\tprivate void btnApply_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e) {\n  2 \t\t\tif(File.Exists(transformPath)){\n  3 \t\t\t\tFile.Delete(transformPath);\n  4 \t\t\t}\n  5\n  6 \t\t\tStreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(transformPath, false); //doesn't release file handle?\n  7 \t\t\tsw.Write(this.rtbTransform.Text);\n  8 \t\t\tsw.Flush();\n  9 \t\t\tsw.Close();\n 10\n 11 \t\t\tthis.Close();\n 12 \t\t}\n\nNotice my little note to myself? It turned out that I tried using the using\nstatement, using File.CreateText(transformPath) (which is why the pre-step\nFile.Delete is in there) and I kept getting \"Cannot access file 'blah' because\nit is in use by another process.\" When I opened up sysinternal's process\nexplorer and searched for the file, it said that the file handle was opened by\nRssBandit. grr.\n\nAll I ended up having to do was to add one argument to File.Open from the\nXsltStream property getter:\n\n  1 \t\tStream XsltStream\n  2 \t\t{\n  3 \t\t\tget\n  4 \t\t\t{\n  5 \t\t\t\tstring filePath = Path.Combine(ConfigurationPath, this.BlogType.ToString() + \".xslt\");\n  6 \t\t\t\tif(File.Exists(filePath)){\n  7 \t\t\t\t\t//read from a file stream.\n  8 \t\t\t\t\tFileStream fs = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);\n  9 \t\t\t\t\treturn (Stream)fs;\n 10 \t\t\t\t}else{\n 11 \t\t\t\t\tstring resourceName = \"PostXING.Rss.BlogExtensions.Resources.\" + this.BlogType.ToString() + \".xslt\";\n 12 \t\t\t\t\treturn Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream(resourceName);\n 13 \t\t\t\t}\n 14 \t\t\t}\n 15 \t\t}\n\nAnd bam! the problem went away. It looks like the default for a new\nFileStream (sans FileAccess attribute) is FileAccess.ReadWrite.

I found out rather quickly that I was going to need some way to\nconfigure each IPlugin implementation individually, so I \"borrowed\" that part of\nthe contract from IBlogExtension. A couple of properties were required in my\ncase in AppContext -\n\n\t\tprotected bool _isCallingFromHostApplication = true;\n\t\tpublic virtual bool IsCallingFromHostApplication{\n\t\t\tget{return _isCallingFromHostApplication;}\n\t\t\tset{_isCallingFromHostApplication = value;}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tprotected string _currentEditorText = string.Empty;\n\t\tpublic virtual string CurrentEditorText{\n\t\t\tget{ return _currentEditorText;}\n\t\t\tset{ _currentEditorText = value;}\n\t\t}\n\nCurrentEditorText shows up in some of Roy's articles, but not the EAP\nitself. I'm interested in the text, but I can see that CurrentEditorText is not\ngeneric enough to be included by default. This kind of makes me think that the\nEAP is mis-named: it's really a foundation, or building block, whereas the Patterns &amp;\nPractices Application Blocks come kind of ready-to-go OOB. That doesn't\ndetract from its validity and usefulness - I've just become accustomed to not\nhaving to modify an \"Application Block\" to get it working right away.\n\nAnyways, semantics aside, I needed these properties for\ndealing with the IPlugin correctly. The override of CurrentEditorText in my\napp-specific AppContext (called PostXINGAppContext, natch) raises an event\nsaying that it was modified on set, and the consuming event loads the text back\ninto the editor only if the CurrentEditorText was not set by the calling\napplication - I thought that might end up in endless loads of text into the\neditor which would get rid of the usefulness of a plugin. I could be wrong, but\nthat's what I went with, okay?:)\n\nI found it useful to inherit my IPlugin implementation from the\nGenericDockablePlugin, even tho there is no UI except for the NetSpell-supplied\ndialogs. This way, I was able to set an icon thru the designer and have it\nembedded as a resource instead of including it with the install of the dll. It\nwas just the easiest way to get from idea to implementation for me.\n\nIn summary, the EAP is great as a building block for getting plugin\nfunctionality into your windows forms app. With some minor modifications, I was\nable to pull functionality that was originally going to be part of the host\napplication out into a plugin in a few hours.\n\n[ Currently Playing : Tip Your Bartender - Glassjaw - Worship\n&amp; Tribute (2:59) ]"},{"layout":"post","title":"RE: I am Nerdier than Paul","slug":"2005-01-06-RE-I-am-Nerdier-than-Paul","body":"I am:\nNot nerdy, but definitely not hip.\n"},{"layout":"post","title":"Using the NetSpell plugin for PostXING.","slug":"2005-01-06-Using-the-NetSpell-plugin-for-PostXING","body":"With the latest release\nof PostXING, a plugin architecture\nhas been added to allow for external extensions such as the new NetSpellPlugin that\nadds spell checking to PostXING.\nAll that is required to install the plugin is to add the .dll file to the\nplugins subdirectory of PostXING's install directory, for me that's\nC:\\bin\\PostXING\\plugins. When you start PostXING, you should see a new button in\nthe toolbar:\n\nas well as a couple of entries in the plugins menu under the Tools main\nmenu:\n\nI really wish that was all there was to it, but unfortunately there's more\nthat needs to be done.

Here's how to get the\nen-US.dic dictionary file from the command line:\nCreate a .bat file called getdic or whatever and put it either in your PATH\nor in SourceGear vault's install directory. Navigate to where vault.exe is\nlocated (for me it was cd C:\\Program Files\\SourceGear\\Vault Client). Drop\nsomething like the following into the .bat file:\n\n  mkdir C:\\tmp\\vaultpub\n  vault get -host vaultpub.sourcegear.com -user guest -password guest\n  -repository postxing -makewritable -destpath C:\\tmp\\vaultpub\n  $/ThirdParty/dic/en-US.dic\nVault should tell you if you were successful or not in downloading\nthe file. Note that the vault command above is all on one line. I don't know if\nthe -makewritable is necessary or not, but this is what worked for me. Remember,\nif you prefer to blog in a different language (or a different, erm, dialect? of\nEnglish) the ones available in vaultpub and from the NetSpell component itself\nare:\nde-DE.dicen-AU.dicen-CA.dicen-GB.dicen-US.dices-ES.dices-MX.dicfr-FR.dicit-IT.dic\nNow that you've downloaded the correct dictionary file, go to Tools\n-&gt; Plugins -&gt; ...- Configure and you'll be greeted by this simple\ndialog:\n\nAbove, we said download to C:\\tmp\\vaultpub(\\en-US.dic) so navigate\nthere and hit OK. (side note: this is necessary because depending on where\nPostXING is launched from, i.e. standalone or from the BlogThisUsingPostXINGPlugin,\nNetSpell will look in a different path (I think the Application.StartupPath) for\nthe default dictionary based on your cultureInfo. This way, you can blog in\nEnglish no matter what your cultureInfo is set to.)\nYou should now be able to spell check any Post from PostXING using\neither the toolbar button or the menu item.\n[ Currently Playing : 99 Problems - Jay-Z - The Black Album\n(3:54) ]"},{"layout":"post","title":"RE: Couple of feature requests","slug":"2005-01-07-RE-Couple-of-feature-requests","body":"\n   Couple of feature requests posted by Bob\n  Yexley on 1/7/2005 12:02:04 PM : Hey nice work on the latest\n  version. Spell checking works very nicely. There are a couple of things that\n  I've noticed about the application that I thought would make it nicer that I\n  wanted to mention. Fairly simple I'm pretty sure.First off, especially\n  with all of the different version releases you've had lately, I've wanted to\n  check the \"About\" box to make sure that the correct new version was running\n  after the new version, and I noticed that the current version isn't displayed\n  on it. It would be great to have the current version displayed on the About\n  box just for reference if nothing else.I've also noticed that when I\n  switch to the \"Preview\" tab, that the toolbar with the \"Post &amp; Publish\"\n  button disappears. Normally when I compose a new entry, I write it up in the\n  editor tab, and then I check spelling (well, I will from now on anyway), and\n  then I switch over to the preview tab to make sure everything looks OK with my\n  stylesheets applied and all. Well, if everything looks good, I'd like to be\n  able to just click \"Post &amp; Publish\" right then and there, but since that\n  toolbar is gone, I have to switch back to \"Design\" view to get that toolbar\n  back to publish the entry. It seems to me like that's a fairly common toolbar,\n  and maybe it (or it's buttons) should just be added to the standard toolbar\n  that has the \"Setting\" button on it. At very least, it would be nice to have\n  that one button displayed when using the \"Preview\" tab.Thanks for the\n  great free application though. I love it.\nNow, that is some great feedback. I've got seperate use cases\nthan what I always do and clear concise suggestions on how to implement them.\nThese are the types of things that you as a developer don't tend to think of all\nthe time because you are used to a certain useage scenario.

Here was the problem with both: the webserver that I wanted to get to is behind an OpenBSD firewall.\n\nSo, first things first: I added a rule to pf.conf that allowed ssh to be redirected to the private address of my webserver using rdr syntax:\n\nrdr pass on $ext_if from any to $public_address port ssh \\\n-&gt; $private_address\n\nThis rule passes ssh calls bound for the external address to be sent to the\ninternal network address (192.168.1.blah).\n\nBut what about ssh running on Windows?\n\nWell, if you don't already have cygwin installed on the server, I ended up\nusing sshwindows (linked from\nthe OpenSSH site under Windows) Just follow the instructions in readme.txt or quickstart.txt and you should be good to go there - it comes with an installer, so it was pretty easy to get up and running.\n\nBut what about the client on Windows?\nFor this, I use PuTTY. I've used\nit for a while to ssh into my OpenBSD machines from windows. What I didn't know of is the Tunnel feature that sits near the end of the config setup tree...this is how the magic happens.\n\nSee, before, when I needed to get into a firewalled computer, I would just add rules to the firewall to punch temporary holes while I did what I had to do remotely. I know, bad Chris. Using OpenSSH to tunnel the traffic that would normally be sent unencrypted over the wire makes me feel a lot safer, even tho the server in question doesn't have a whole lot of goodies to look at. It's still important to me.\n\nSo how does the magic happen?\n\nUsing the tunnel feature of PuTTY, I added a link to port 5901 and mapped it to localhost:5900. Here's the rub: localhost in this case refers to the ssh server, not the computer the client is running from. The 5901 refers to the machine that the client is running from. This wasn't clear to me in either tutorial that I read thru. So you add the tunnel link to the SSH/tunels node of\nPuTTY and when you fire up VNC, have it sent to localhost:1. This was also not very clear from either article (but that just probably means I'm dense).\n\nIs that it?\nFor VNC, yeah, it is. However, I also run a couple of applications on my\nnetwork that contain sensitive data: namely SourceGear Vault and Dragnet. I want to get to these too! Can I do it in a similar way to the VNC deal? You betcha!\n\nThis time, for the tunnel link I specified an arbitrary (but often used) high port in PuTTY: 8000. I also wanted to point to the internal server (say, 192.168.1.2) so instead of specifying localhost:80 (which is already exposed -duh!) I pointed it to 192.168.1.2:80.\n\nFire up PuTTY, login as some user that's configured for OpenSSH, and point my browser of choice to http://localhost:8000/dragnet.

I think maybe so :) In order:\n\n  I did this in a very early build of PostXING, but got some feedback that\n  asked to be able to immediately edit the post that was just, erm, posted - in\n  case of typos or whatever. I guess I could make it configurable, that\n  shouldn't be too hard. Since you are literally the first person to ask for\n  this feature, I think I'll make the current behavior the default.\n  I don't know how to tackle this one - PostXING is basically just a wrapper\n  for SOME functionality of the Metaweblog API. Generally, the\n  blog engine will handle the entry IDs. Sometimes it gives you an int,\n  sometimes it gives you a string.\n  I actually tried to do this at one point, but I'm not sure how stable it\n  would be. Think about it this way: in order for this to work, images would\n  have to be parsed out (not a problem) and each one uploaded one at a time\n  using the FTP component.

After I\ninstalled it, I noticed the same thing - so I decided to hack it a little bit\nand find out what was going wrong. It turns out that the software is just doing\nwhat the guys at telligent are telling it to - thankfully I've got the code and\nI can poke around when I find little issues like this :)\n\nFirst, I added a call to the Globals class to return a formatted url with the\napplication path intact. This was in Components.SiteUrlsData.cs:\n\npublic virtual string FormatUrl(string name, params object[] parameters)\n{\n    if(parameters == null)\n        return Globals.FullPath(this.Paths[name]);\n\n    else\n        return Globals.FullPath(string.Format(Paths[name],parameters));\n}\n\nBut wait! This causes the rss feed to show up with something silly like http:\n/ /localhost/cshttp://localhost/cs/blog... for the links in the RSS and Atom\nfeeds produced by CSBlogs. So, I tried it without the \"HostPath\" to see if I\ncould get the same results. This was in\nBlogs.Components.BaseWeblogSyndicationHandler:\n\n///\n/// Appends http://Host:Port to all blog urls\n///\nprotected override string BaseUrl\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return \"\"; //return Globals.HostPath(Context.Request.Url);\n    }\n}\n\nThat's it right? Nope, not if you have galleries enabled. One of the methods\n(that I know of :) uses the modified FormatUrl above to try and get a MapPath to\na directory. You'll find out really quickly that MapPath doesn't like\nfully-qualified urls passed to it...I know I did. So, I modified one more line\nto make sure that I've got a relative path passed into the photo gallery. This\nwas in Galleries.Components.Picture:\n\n///\n/// This static method gets the location of the picture cache directory, mapped on the local filesystem.\n///\n/// string\npublic static string CacheDirectory()\n{\n\tUri uri = new Uri(GalleryUrls.Instance().PictureCache);\n\treturn CSContext.Current.Context.Server.MapPath(uri.AbsolutePath);\n}\n\nAfter that, everything seems to be running as normal. I don't know if I'd\nrecommend doing something like this on your install, especially if things are\nworking well enough for you. I just use this particular feature of the Metablog\nAPI quite often, so it bit me a lot.\n\nupdate: It looks like the trackback feature uses fully\nqualified urls as well as the rss/atom feeds. I'll post a fix tomorrow when I\nfind out where the BaseUrl is set for the trackbacks.\n\nupdate2: Found it :) I would've got it done last\nnight, but I don't have the broadband yet. Any ways, like I thought it was just\na removal of a baseUrl parameter (case notwithstanding). I found this in\nBlogs.Controls.TrackbackMarkup:\n\nprotected override void Render(HtmlTextWriter writer)\n{\n\n    if(IsValid)\n    {\n        string baseUrl = Globals.HostPath(Context.Request.Url);\n\twriter.WriteLine(tag,/baseUrl+/PermaLink,Title,/baseUrl+/PingUrl);\n    }\n}\n\n[ Currently Playing : Rooster - Alice in Chains - Unplugged\n(6:40) ]"},{"layout":"post","title":"Enabling styles in CS","slug":"2005-03-24-Enabling-styles-in-CS","body":"Straight from ScottW, I added\n\n&lt;MarkUp&gt;\n\t&lt;globalAttributes&gt;\n\t\t&lt;class enable = \"true\" /&gt;\n\t\t&lt;align enable = \"true\" /&gt;\n\t\t&lt;style enable = \"true\" /&gt;\n\t\t&lt;id enable = \"true\" /&gt;\n\t&lt;/globalAttributes&gt;\n\nnotice the style element?

This is more my style than using stinkin' DataSets. You can see what I\ndid at bluefenix.net .

Well, pretty much the whole\nsite is Lorem Ipsum text right now, except for the Projects.aspx page.\nThe page consists of two DataLists, an ObjectDataSource and a SqlDataSource.\nFor the ObjectDataSource, all I did was add a web reference to the website and\npoint the SELECT part of the datasource to the method that had the info that I\nwanted to display. That worked off my local machine perfectly, but I needed to\ngo thru a proxy at the host to make the webservice work correctly. Getting this\nworking was a simple matter of creating a wrapper to the webmethod that included\nadding proxy info to the webservice stub class before calling the webmethod.\nChanging the ObjectDataSource's SELECT section to use the new class that was\ndropped into App_Code got everything working, locally and in production!\nVery cool, indeed.\n[ Currently Playing : Imagine - A Perfect Circle - eMOTIVe (4:48)\n]"},{"layout":"post","title":"PSKit&#58; FormView initial thoughts","slug":"2005-04-29-PSKit-FormView-initial-thoughts","body":"I've been playing with the Personal Website\nStarter Kit a little bit lately.

Now, let me say that it is very...what's the word? liberating? to\nbe able to do most of the work in the designer without worrying about the\ndesigner nuking stuff. It's almost there. One thing that I thought was missing\nwas the ability to specify one of the connectionStrings from the web.config file\nas the connection string source - you've got to switch to source view to do that\n(afaict). Also, the friggin thing doesn't want to work unless I supply a\nDefaultValue for each &lt;asp:ControlParameter/&gt; in the markup - so what\nhappens when my ID changes?\nOne other thing that I'd like to see (I know, give an inch, take a mile:)\nwould be the ability to use the same SqlDataSource for many FormViews. As the\ndefault.aspx is laid out now, there are 3, maybe 4 areas that would be good\ncandidates for being populated from the Content table outlined above. So\nif I had FormView2, FormView3, and FormView4, I would like to associate them all\nwith the same SqlDataSource and vary the output based on a different ContentID\nfor each. Right now, it seems like there is a 1:1 mapping between each\nSqlDataSource and FormView (as the ControlParameter has a ControlID associated\nwith it.)

I find that simply incredible. And\n  incredibly useful.\nI was told by martouf5 that the motto of bittorrent is \"give and you shall\nreceive\" - he said that was pretty much the attitude of this particular channel,\nand they all volunteer and help out people as they can.

I wasn't sure if this (\n  User.IsInRole(\"Administrators\")) would work at first because it's\n  deceptively simple. But yeah, it does work. Works great!\n\n  I did most of this visually - there is no longer a reason to fear the\n  designer in asp.net (thanks Venus team!)\n\n  I had to disable Page input validation because I want the Content to\n  contain html, and by default, it don't like that.\n\nAs for the codebehind, I guess I could have refactored it a little bit, but\nsince this is not a mission-critical application (it is just a personal site,\nafter all!) I just went the easy route and duplicated a lot of code. Probably\nthe best thing to do would be to handle just the ItemCommand because there is no\ndefault handler for add and use a clever mix of a switch statement and\ndefaulting the value of EditItemIndex to -1. But this isn't about best\npractices, it's about getting the stuff to work, ya know? Anyway, here's the\ncode:\n\n  1 \tprotected void DataList1_CancelCommand(object source, DataListCommandEventArgs e)\n  2 \t{\n  3 \t\tthis.DataList1.EditItemIndex = -1;\n  4 \t\tthis.DataList1.DataBind();\n  5 \t}\n  6 \tprotected void DataList1_UpdateCommand(object source, DataListCommandEventArgs e)\n  7 \t{\n  8 \t\tstring heading = ((TextBox)e.Item.FindControl(\"txtHeading\")).Text;\n  9 \t\tstring content = ((TextBox)e.Item.FindControl(\"txtContent\")).Text;\n 10 \t\tstring isvisible = ((CheckBox)e.Item.FindControl(\"chkVisible\")).Checked.ToString();\n 11 \t\tstring id = ((Label)e.Item.FindControl(\"lblContentID\")).Text;\n 12\n 13 \t\tthis.SqlDataSource1.UpdateParameters[\"Content_ID\"].DefaultValue = id;\n 14 \t\tthis.SqlDataSource1.UpdateParameters[\"Heading\"].DefaultValue = heading;\n 15 \t\tthis.SqlDataSource1.UpdateParameters[\"Content\"].DefaultValue = content;\n 16 \t\tthis.SqlDataSource1.UpdateParameters[\"IsVisible\"].DefaultValue = isvisible;\n 17\n 18 \t\tthis.SqlDataSource1.Update();\n 19\n 20 \t\tthis.DataList1.EditItemIndex = -1;\n 21 \t\tthis.DataList1.DataBind();\n 22 \t}\n 23 \tprotected void DataList1_DeleteCommand(object source, DataListCommandEventArgs e)\n 24 \t{\n 25 \t\tstring id = ((HiddenField)e.Item.FindControl(\"hdnContentID\")).Value;\n 26 \t\tthis.SqlDataSource1.DeleteParameters[\"Content_ID\"].DefaultValue = id;\n 27\n 28 \t\tthis.SqlDataSource1.Delete();\n 29\n 30 \t\tthis.DataList1.EditItemIndex = -1;\n 31 \t\tthis.DataList1.DataBind();\n 32 \t}\n 33 \tprotected void DataList1_ItemCommand(object source, DataListCommandEventArgs e)\n 34 \t{\n 35 \t\tswitch (e.CommandName)\n 36 \t\t{\n 37 \t\t\tcase \"add\":\n 38 \t\t\t\tstring heading = ((TextBox)e.Item.FindControl(\"txtHeading\")).Text;\n 39 \t\t\t\tstring content = ((TextBox)e.Item.FindControl(\"txtContent\")).Text;\n 40 \t\t\t\tstring isvisible = ((CheckBox)e.Item.FindControl(\"chkVisible\")).Checked.ToString();\n 41\n 42 \t\t\t\tthis.SqlDataSource1.InsertParameters[\"Heading\"].DefaultValue = heading;\n 43 \t\t\t\tthis.SqlDataSource1.InsertParameters[\"Content\"].DefaultValue = content;\n 44 \t\t\t\tthis.SqlDataSource1.InsertParameters[\"IsVisible\"].DefaultValue = isvisible;\n 45\n 46 \t\t\t\tthis.SqlDataSource1.Insert();\n 47\n 48 \t\t\t\tthis.DataList1.EditItemIndex = -1;\n 49 \t\t\t\tthis.DataList1.DataBind();\n 50 \t\t\t\tbreak;\n 51 \t\t}\n 52 \t}\n\nThis is the quickest way I could figure out to make things work, and yeah, it\ndoes work. So, there you have it - even though there are only two items\ncurrently in the table, it's very easy to add content via in-place editing and\nchange what is currently there as well.

I pretty much\nalways use PostXING while online,\nso this particular feature didn't even cross my mind. As a side effect, this\nwill let me add categories to posts off of my CS blog which gives a nice little\nerror when I try to get the comments list currently. Good one, Wally.\nThe other thing is that I want to expand the abilities of where\nPostXING can post - not just using the Metablog API, but being able to use\ndifferent services. I don't want to use the \"provider model\" because I\ndon't think that particular pattern fits what I have in my head to make\nthis work. Close, as a matter of fact, very close, but not exactly what I'm\nlooking for.\nThe basic idea that I have now is based on the fact that a lot of the\nfunctionality that PostXING uses now already sits in separate dll's in the\napplication root. I think that I can factor out the API specific functionality\ninto kind of a plugin - thereby expanding the end applications that can be\nposted to from PostXING. I haven't hashed out all of the details yet. This is\nstill a brainstorm at this point. However it works out, it's going to be a major\nversion change.\nIf this can work out the way I think it can, this could be a very cool\naddition to PostXING.

I\nfeel like there is something that I'm missing in the ideas that I'm having, so\nI'm taking this slowly, step by step. To be honest, I've always had this idea in\nmy head for PostXING. It's why it's built the way it is - I've left\nextensibility points open at the expense of writing a bit more code on the\nonset. When I'm done, a developer that has a good handle on the API they want to\npost to will be able to author a plugin/provider, drop it into a subdirectory\noff of the application root, and be able to use PostXING as kind of a shell to\npost to their custom API.\n[ Currently Playing : Sad Statue - System of a Down - Mezmerize\n(3:25) ]"},{"layout":"post","title":"We're back online!","slug":"2005-05-25-Were-back-online","body":"\nIt seems that there was a major power failure yesterday: at least a few city\nblocks.

I recently picked up a copy of the src to FlexWikiPad.\nI just wanted to see how things were wired together in there: I only have a very\nold installation of FlexWiki sitting around that still looks like crap in\nFireFox.\nTo his credit, Craig has\ndone an awesome job of making FlexWikiPad very testable - something I didn't\nthink was all that easy to do in winforms. Apparently, his dialogs are very\nhumble. He's using a pretty strict Model View\nPresenter (or controller, whatever) pattern throughout the application. I\nthought this was a lot of extra coding at first (it kinda is), but in the\nprocess Craig has made FlexWikiPad easier to maintain and update thru the use of\nmocks/stubs and tests with this pattern.\nCurrently, I've got this itch that I want to scratch with regards to PostXING that would have been so\nnice to be able to test my way thru. I'm just hacking thru it now, and I've\ndone a pretty good job of messing everything up so far :) In my\ndefense, I'm still learning unit testing and when it comes to winform\napplications I feel that there is a balance that I like to hit right on the line\nof usability and architectural beauty.

That was priority #2 for me with PostXING. Priority #1 was to\nmake something useful that I could use to learn winforms.\nAnyways, I'm hoping that I can glean some insight off of people like Craig\nthat are way more knowledgable than me on this front. If I feel like the task\nfor PostXING to be testable is too great, I may just try to apply this knowledge\nto future projects.

Interfaces are a language\nfeature that is really powerful - you don't really start to appreciate it until\nyou are faced with situations that would otherwise be impossible to deal\nwith.\nPostXING already uses interfaces to load plugins like the NetSpellPlugin for spell\nchecking. So I thought hey, go with what you know for this plugin/provider idea\nthat I've had stewing in my head for a while. I've already included MikeDub's awesome IUI library (modified with - you guessed\nit, interfaces!)\nso I figured I might as well milk that for all it's worth. And trust me, I am\n:)\nThe idea I have is to use IUI to set up a new/edit an existing \"blog\" (what\nPostXING sees as a blog) and let each plugin/provider take care of any special\nconfiguration they might need. But there's a problem - every provider should\nhave common attributes defined within the interface, but there is also non-blog\ninformation that I would like to store (like ftp settings, whether or not you\nwant media information to show up like below (I know, Alice in Chains again - I\njust write good code to that CD), and preview formatting).\nSo, how do I communicate that the custom IUI pages are done so that the rest\nof the configuration can continue? Well, I could use a vanilla\nEventHandler event, but how can I make sure that the main exe project will be\nable to handle the event without knowing which provider has been loaded?\nFurthermore, how can the provider send up an event for it to catch without\nhaving a reference to the main exe project (a circular dependency - nono!)?\nInterfaces.\nI create an interface that only the dialog that shows the configuration pages\nshould implement. It could be a simple interface with only 1 to 3 methods\ndefined for it (if I want to only expose moving forward to one page vs. moving\nto any available page thereafter)...see what I'm getting at? Maybe some code\nwill better explain what I'm getting at:\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections;\n\npublic interface IFoo{\n\tvoid HandleEvent(object sender, EventArgs e);\n}\n\npublic class FooInstance : IFoo{\n\tpublic void HandleEvent(object sender, EventArgs e){\n\t\tSystem.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show(\"Handled!

Booyakasha indeed. Here, IFoo is the interface\nthat is implemented by the dialog.

It's been a while since I've gotten some good PostXING feedback. Guess\nthe current version isn't very keyboard-friendly.

As a matter of fact, I welcome all criticism in the hopes of\nmaking PostXING a product that works really well for more than just myself.\nAnyways, Peter has\nsome good feedback for PostXING in general, my responses follow his post:\n\n  I decided today to try out PostXING\n  as an alternative to BlogJet. So far my\n  reaction is mixed.\n  Pros\n\n    Seems to have good WYSIWYG support\n\n    I like having the standard HTML heading tags\n    available in the toolbar.\n\n    I can easily insert a horizontal rule in my\n    post\n\n    I love the fact that it has the CodeHTMLer syntax\n    hilighting engine in it, but it doesn't feel quite as smooth to me as\n    BlogJet does.\n\n    I'm very glad that it supports uploading\n    images via FTP in the same way that BlogJet does. This is a must have in my\n    book.\n\n    As with BlogJet, I can't open an arbitrary\n    post by ID. I have to find it in the historical list of posts, which sucks\n    when the post is from a year ago.\n  Cons\n\n    I have to click a button and wait for a popup\n    to set the post's categories\n\n    I can't use TAB to navigate the UI\n    which means I have to use the mouse (a serious usability error as far as I'm\n    concerned). And I don't know if I agree with the idea that TAB causes\n    BLOCKQUOTE in the resulting HTML.\n\n    I can't find keystrokes for many of the\n    standard formatting things like ordered and unordered lists, styles,\n    etc.\n\n    Sometimes after using CTRL+K to format some\n    text as a link (good), the input focus leaves the text editor and goes up to\n    Title field (bad).\n\n    I can't figure out how to post with a\n    keystroke. It should be CTRL+Enter (like Outlook and BlogJet) but it\n    isn't.\n  This will be my first post with it, we'll\n  see if it is also my last. If the author can fix a few of those cons, I would\n  be considering switching. For now though, I'm not so sure.\n  This seems like such a simple problem...\n  I can't believe how poor all the choices really are.\n\n[Via Geek\nNoise]\nI'll try to address these as best I can, starting with the last Pro...\n\n    This is a drawback of the MetaWeblog API, which is why you see the same\n    behavior across both BlogJet and PostXING. The only way to really\n    get around this is to use a different API to access your blog, like perhaps\n    the webservice API in CS. Hopefully when CS v2 drops I'll be able to code up\n    a plugin/provider that allows native access to the webservice api instead of\n    having to use mwb all the time.\n    In v2, the popup is replaced with a \"Container Bar\", but it's still the\n    same concept. How would you rather see the category feature implemented?\n    Perhaps as a dropdown next to the title kind of like w.bloggar?\n    PostXING does capture the tab key in the editor surface to create a\n    blockquote: I did this to be able to format quotes quickly. Maybe it was a\n    wrong decision, but this is the first time that I've ever heard anything bad\n    (if a Con is bad) about it. I could for sure make this configurable, but\n    what should the default behavior be? Insert 4 spaces, or be able to tab\n    around the rest of the application? I guess at the time that I implemented\n    the tab capture, I figured the editor experience was the main focus of\n    PostXING.\n    You can't find these keystrokes because they don't exist. What should\n    they be?\n    This is 100% mshtml code (especially the ctrl+k part). I don't know how\n    to address this but like all of the other points I'm open to suggestion.\n    Again, there is no keystroke for this.

As others have said (and I\ncompletely\nagree ) windowsforms.net is pretty useless. Well, there's some new\nWhidbey .NET 2.0 content, but all of the things I enjoyed when\nstarting w/ v1 of .NET (like, erm, QuickStarts? What happened to installing\nthose locally?) seem to be gone. To be fair, they do have a presence over on forums.microsoft.com where\nthere are a few PM's and devs answering questions. I even found a\nhack fix for my dilemma via one of the posts that links to a download\nfrom Beta 2 or somewhere close.\nAt first I was optimistic about the DataGridView samples (overview)(Download\nThe DataGridView samples), but I didn't see anything that did what I wanted\nto do: take an enum value and represent it in the grid with a combobox. So,\nhere's how I did it.\nFirst, I just plopped a DataGridView onto a form and gave it a BindingSource.\nThe bindingSource gets its DataSource property set via a call into my DAL that\nreturns a DataTable://CF: set to null before setting it to the current to\n//clear out previous results\nthis.bindingSource1.DataSource = null;\n\nthis.bindingSource1.DataSource = MyDal.GetDataTable();\nThen comes the hackery. Since I have about 20 columns in this DataTable, all\nof interest as far as values but not all needing to be visible, directly after\n(like the line after) setting the datasource, I call a method to format the\ngrid. This method looks something like this:private void _formatGrid(){\n\tthis.dataGridView1.Columns[\"ID\"].Visible = false;\n\tthis.dataGridView1.Columns.Remove(\"Status\");//CF: this is where we want enums.\n\t...\n\tthis._formatStatusColumn();\n}\nThen the _formatStatusColumn method is where the magick happens:DataTable dt = new DataTable(\"Status\");\n\n//CF: actually how it's stored in the db.\ndt.Columns.Add(\"Status\", typeof(int));\ndt.Columns.Add(\"Status_Name\", typeof(string));\n\n//CF: this way I can add or remove enum values, and\n//the combo will always reflect the correct values.\nforeach(int index in Enum.GetValues(typeof(Status)){\n\tdt.Rows.Add(index, Enum.GetName(typeof(Status), index));\n}\n\n//CF: now for the UI column\nDataGridViewComboBoxColumn statusColumn =\n\tnew DataGridViewComboBoxColumn();\n\n//CF: seems to control where the column is placed.\nstatusColumn.DisplayIndex = 3;\nstatusColumn.HeaderText = \"Status\";\n\nstatusColumn.DataPropertyName = \"Status\";\nstatusColumn.DataSource = dt;\nstatusColumn.DisplayMember = \"Status_Name\";\nstatusColumn.ValueMember = \"Status\";\n\nthis.dataGridView1.Columns.Add(statusColumn);\nI was hoping that there would be some way to predefine columns so I\ndon't have to filter and rebuild every time I get data from the database, but I\ncouldn't find anything on it. There is no SelectedIndex member of the\nDataGridViewComboBoxCell, either.\nI really hope this helps someone else out there: I tried for a day and a half\nto get this to work, and I still think it looks like a hack.\n"},{"layout":"post","title":"PostXING conversation with Peter Provost continues...","date":"2005-12-07 21:07","author":"chrispelatari","comments":true,"categories":["professional_geek"],"slug":"2005-12-07-postxing-conversation-with-peter-provost-continues","body":"\nPeter gives me some awesome\nfeedback:\n\n  Hey man. Glad to know you're listening. I really think that PostXING could\n  rock with a little more TLC. You're doing great. A few comments on\n  your comments: 1. I don't think you understand my request. Assume for\n  a second that I know that I want to open post ID 117, I should be able to\n  \"Open 117\" instead of \"open, browse, wait, wait, 117, OK\". I know this can be\n  done with MWAPI 'cause I wrote one. metaWeblog.getPost takes postid, username\n  and password, right? 2. For categories, I want to be able to select\n  the category(s) for the post quickly and without waiting for stuff. So cache\n  them, let me reload the cache, and enabled me to select them with the keyboard\n  without a lot of fuss. BlogJet is pretty good on this front. 3. I\n  understand your choice here, but I think you would be better to choose the\n  standard keystroke used by Outlook, FrontPage, BlogJet, etc: Ctrl+M and\n  Ctrl+Shift+M. Not the best keystrokes in the world, but they are what people\n  are used to. 4. Make all the keystrokes configurable! :) That solves\n  many/all of my issues., eh? 5. What I'm saying is that after using\n  Ctrl+K (which I realize is a MSHTML command), and the focus returns back to\n  the app, the input focus should stay where it was. I suspect you have\n  something going on in Form_Activate that sets the focus somewhere. Try it,\n  you'll see what I mean. 6. Ctrl+Enter should be Post &amp; Publish.\n  Personally I don't think Post (w/o Publish) has any value at all. If I can\n  save locally, I don't need to post without publishing. Thanks! Keep up\n  the good work!\nWe sure like lists, eh? :) Here's mine in response again:\n\n  This can be done, absolutely. (meaning I understand now ;) Maybe a\n  command that just loads a post into the editing surface?\n\n  This is something I've actually had on the plate for a long time that\n  will probably never make it into v1 of PostXING. Since I'm working on v2, tho, it can\n  definitely make it into that code. This will also improve the offline story\n  (currently falls back to an empty textbox where each category gets its own\n  line.)\n\n  Sounds good, definitely will look into this one too.\n\n  Wow, that sounds like a lot to do...how many keystrokes should be\n  supported, how could I map them to logical commands, should it be per-user?\n  Lots of questions on that one, I had never thought of doing something like\n  this before.\n\n  I actually got a tip from Dmitry (creator of BlogJet) on how to deal with\n  this issue. Apparently, mshtml has a focus issue that needs to be explicitly\n  handled.\n\n  Consider it done.\nThanks again, Peter.

The original code for switching my networks is still in there (and still works on my machine if I change the code to point there) but I made it more general and also used it as an excuse to explore the Settings API as well as use a couple of neat features of VS 2005. (If you don't care about any of that stuff and just want to see if you can build the project and make some use out of it, it can be found here on projectdistributor. )So the settings goop in VS 2005 is pretty neat, but there's a limited subset (it seems) that you can specify as types in the designer. I wanted to use a Domain Object, tho - so, no designer love for me. I ended up making a simple string setting just to see what code it generated for UserScopedSetting properties. I ended up with this:[global::System.Configuration.UserScopedSetting]\npublic ConfigItem Disconnected {\n\tget {\n\t\tif (this[\"Disconnected\"] == null) {\n\t\t\tConfigItem item = new ConfigItem();\n\t\t\titem.IPAddress = \"127.0.0.1\";\n\t\t\titem.Condition = ConditionKind.Equals;\n\t\t\titem.DisplayText = \"disconnected.\";\n\t\t\titem.Icon = IconKind.Disconnected;\n\t\t\tthis[\"Disconnected\"] = item;\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn (ConfigItem)this[\"Disconnected\"];\n\t}\n\tset {\n\t\tthis[\"Disconnected\"] = value;\n\t}\n}I found that a suitable default value was needed to start off with in settings, so I did something similar for a Home, Work, Unknown, and Other network. This way I can persist the Settings using the Settings API instead of something home cooked (although I'm not sure if you would have to to avoid version conflicts...) UserScopedSettings look to me a lot like IsolatedStorage, that is the version and the product name help determine where settings should go. If you wanted to use the same settings across different versions, I guess you would have to copy the user.config file from one version location to the next.Next I wanted to see what the designer had to offer. The table layout panel was real nice. It took care of all of my layout issues with respect to space. To get what I wanted done, I first created a dummy Collection that inherits from System.ComponentModel.BindingList&lt;&gt;:internal class ConfigItemList : BindingList&lt;ConfigItem&gt; {}This is how I was able to add it as an Object datasource to the Data Sources window:From there, you can change the type of control you would like to output. I simply Dock.Fill 'ed the TableLayoutPanel and added the correct amount of rows. To get the labels to line up with the controls, I set all of their AnchorStyles to Top | Left (that's Top AND Left). When each usercontrol is loaded up, I manually bind to the information. When the Save button is clicked, all of the info gets put back into the Settings object from the controls and Settings.Default.Save() is called. This automatically saves the changed data to a safe location under Documents And Settings (specifically Local SettingsApplication DataCompanyNameFileName+ a bunch of other stuffProductVersion).Now, for the main reason I created this thing: I host a few external sites at work, and I can't see them without an entry in my hosts file (%windir%system32driversetchosts) for each one. At home (or anywhere else) however, I need to be able to rely on DNS to be able to get me to those sites, so I created 2 extra hosts files, hosts.work and hosts.home. hosts.home pretty much just has the single entry:127.0.0.1    localhostwhereas hosts.work contains definitions to the internal network address of the servers involved. I created 2 batch files that copy over the hosts file depending on where I am. The one to switch to work has the following command:copy /Y %windir%system32driversetchosts.work %windir%system32driversetchostsand the one for home simply replaces hosts.home into the hosts file the same way. So the command to execute for work is the fully qualified path to the bat file. Everything else has the fully qualified path to the switch to home batch script. So now, I just have this small utility run on startup and stay in the tray, and whenever the network is changed, I am automatically configured to go with this utility.[ Currently Playing : Quarantined - At the Drive-In - Relationship of Command (5:24) ]\n"},{"layout":"post","title":"MSN Spaces opens up MetaWeblog API support","date":"2005-12-13 16:34","author":"chrispelatari","comments":true,"categories":["professional_geek"],"slug":"2005-12-13-msn-spaces-opens-up-metaweblog-api-support","body":"\nAnd now I can post there with PostXING (v2).\nDare has put up a couple\nof tutorials\non how to setup Metablog support for w.bloggar and BlogJet.

First, you have to be working in .net 2.0 WinForms. Second, you must be using a custom application context. Third and most importantly, you must have at least one form open in your application that handles its closing event and sets CancelEventArgs.Cancel = true. What's the behavior? While operating under a custom ApplicationContext, what would be my Main form is closed by the user. Since the application context is not associated with that form, I decide to call \"Application.Exit()\" in an override of OnClosing. My Main form closes, but any hidden forms stick around, thus leaving the application running until you open up task manager (or something similar) and manually kill the process. Why does it happen? WinForms 2.0 introduced an overload to Application.Exit that accepts a CancelEventArgs parameter. This is what is called by Application.Exit(). If even one of your open forms doesn't think it needs to close itself for whatever reason and sets its CancelEventArgs to true, Application.Exit stops processing and returns control to the application. Why did I call it a \"regression\"? This behavior has changed between .net 1.1 and 2.0. In 1.1, if I call Application.Exit, by golly the application exits! I understand the reasoning behind the change. I just wish that there was some indication to it other than Reflector. A comment for intellisense perhaps? Something.  Will it matter to most WinForm projects? Probably not. If you use the default application context (by calling Application.Run(new MainForm()), which is what VS.NET spits out for you from the template) you do not have the same problem. Closing the main form exits the application as expected.

So, just throw everything possible at it. Cache can handle that, right? hehe. nope. That's why you think about it, apply it where appropriate, and don't waste cycles calculating if you should even cache or not as part of the caching process of a production site. I dunno, seems like a wasted effort to me, especially when you start to go down the rabbit hole of deciding what should/shouldn't be cached as part of the process.\n\nI'm not posting this to be a jerk...I'm putting your feet to the fire a little! Think it thru a little more, maybe (since I seem to be concentrating on the calculations as part of the process) move that logic outside of the [Deterministic] control flow to an external \"cache minder\" process. have your cake and cache it too.\n but the main point of cache in asp.net is to improve performance by taking anything that takes longer than O(1) and returning it nearly that fast (a guess considering that Cache exposes itself as a Dictionary to store its items) I guess that means my case (while I'm advocating;) is for using the cache as is, and make conscious decisions on what should go into it instead of letting some attribute-fu decide for me.

In order to complete this, you must have sudo privileges on the firewall at cerberus.velocitydatabank.com. After you login, cd to /etc and sudo the su command to easily edit the files we need to touch:  $cd /etc$ sudo su# Let's setup an address as an example. Currently, we have a dmz server called geoweb which is publicly addressed by the host  geoweb.velocitydatabank.com There is a DNS host record (A record) setup in our online services with cbeyond that associates the external IP   69.15.117.100 to this hostname, meaning when someone makes a request to geoweb.velocitydatabank.com, they will be pointed at the above IP address. What we need to do first is tell the external NIC card (xl0) to listen for this IP address along with any other public IP addresses we want to manage. This is done using ifconfig by invoking the alias command. To actually do this, we are going to type in the following command:  ifconfig xl0 alias 69.15.117.100 netmask 0xffffffff Here we are telling ifconfig to configure the interface named xl0 to listen for packets sent to this IP address. The netmask part is a hexidecimal representation of all full octets and is equivalent to 255.255.255.255. This means that we will be broadcasting the exact same IP address as entered. Now the running server knows that it is listening for this IP address. The firewall ruleset allows ping echorequests thru, so if we are at a remote location we can see this by pinging geoweb.velocitydatabank.com. The problem is that we need to make sure the alias is set up even after a reboot. To do this we have to add an entry to the hostname.xl0 file. Using vi, we need to add an alias setting that will load when the os is booting.  #vi hostname.xl0(to get to the end of the text, type shift-G. Open the next line for editing by typing o. So the commands will be: Go Then add the following line to set it up:  alias 69.15.117.100 netmask 255.255.255.255 Hit escape to stop editing and then :x to save your changes. Now we've associated the external IP address to the xl0 nic card. All traffic except ping should be blocked by default, so we have to make some changes to pf.conf to allow dmz traffic to flow to the internal IP when addressed by the external IP. There are already rulesets for other IP addresses in pf.conf - just follow those as an example to allow dmz traffic. Start by adding a macro for both the internal and external IPs. We're going to name them according to the host, adding a prefix to distinguish between publicly addressable and private addresses. Add these under the other macro definitions:  prv_geoweb=\"192.168.0.11\"pa_geoweb=\"69.15.117.100\" Now we need to add a binat rule to link these addresses in the firewall. This only sets up the link, incoming packets will still have to pass the ruleset before being passed thru. Find the other binat rules and add one for the new host:  binat on $ext from $prv_geoweb to any -&gt; $pa_geoweb This tells the firewall that if it gets any packets that are going to or from 192.168.0.11, change their destination/source IP to the external one. The traffic still ends up at the internal IP, but not before passing the filter rules defined below the NAT rules. Pings will still work, but we need to add a filter rule to allow our desired dmz services thru. We need to add the following rule to the ruleset after the other rules that serve the same purpose for other IPs:  pass in on $ext inet proto tcp from any to $prv_geoweb port $dmz_services flags S/SA synproxy state Let's break this rule down. We're telling the firewall to pass or allow a packet to reach its destination (in this case $prv_geoweb or 192.168.0.11) This is slightly confusing, since we really want traffic to go to the public  address, right? Well, in pf the address translation rules are run first, so by the time the packet reaches this rule, it really is heading to the internal address because of the binat rule we defined earlier. $ext is defined as a macro and represents the xl0 nic card. inet tells pf that we are only interested in IPv4 requests at this time. from any simply means that any address whatsoever can reach this IP (the whole point of a dmz). You would change this to a specific IP or IP range if you wanted to lock more people out of even dmz services, for example if we were hosting a client server to be managed by our firewall. to $prv_geoweb is as I stated earlier telling pf that the packet must be heading toward that IP. This allows us to customize the ports available if necessary. port $dmz_services says that the packet must be assigned to one of the ports defined in the $dmz_services macro defined at the top of pf.conf currently as ftp, www, https, and 8080. These abbreviations correspond to standard tcp ports where ftp=21, www=80, and https=443. Any packet that is not heading for one of these ports is dropped and forgotten. (power of the firewall, ya see?;) the slash is a line continuating character, so the next line is part of the same rule. flags S/SA restricts the types of tcp requests that are allowed to pass. They represent syn/syn+ack which does the basic tcp handshake required for network communication. That's all that's required for the ruleset, so save the changes to the file. Now it's time to let pf know about its new config changes. We will do this using pfctl:  #pfctl -f pf.conf This tells pf to load the ruleset contained in the pf.conf file. This is also what is called on startup, so we know we will have the same rules defined even after a reboot. If pfctl doesn't return anything then it worked. You can verify by calling  #pfctl -sa which tells pf to show all of the info associated with it in the console. That's it! geoweb.velocitydatabank.com is now secured thru our OpenBSD packet filter firewall.\n"},{"layout":"post","title":"Blog Moving","date":"2007-11-14 12:35","author":"chrispelatari","comments":true,"categories":["professional_geek"],"slug":"2007-11-14-blog_moving","body":"\nI noticed that a handful of people are still subscribed to this little ol'\nweblog.

I want to be able to set the Color of the rectangle, and of course we have to paint the rectangle so we'll add a Color property of type Color (imagine that:) and override the Paint method.\n\npublic ColorPickerCell : DataGridViewButtonCell{\n  const float phi = 1.618f;\n  private Color colorValue;\n  public Color Color {\n    get { return colorValue; }\n    set {  \n      colorValue = value; \n      this.Value = value.ToArgb().ToString();\n    }\n  }\n\n  protected override void Paint(Graphics graphics, \n    Rectangle clipBounds,\n    Rectangle cellBounds, \n    int rowIndex, \n    DataGridViewElementStates cellState,\n    object value, \n    object formattedValue, \n    string errorText, \n    DataGridViewCellStyle cellStyle, \n    DataGridViewAdvancedBorderStyle advancedBorderStyle, \n    DataGridViewPaintParts paintParts){\n      //CDF: draw the button\n      base.Paint(graphics, clipBounds, cellBounds, rowIndex, cellState, value,     formattedValue, errorText, cellStyle, advancedBorderStyle, paintParts);\n      //CDF: draw a purty rectangle over the button\n      using(Pen darkPen = new Pen(SystemColors.ControlDark){\n        Rectangle rc = new Rectangle(cellBounds.X + 8, cellBounds.Y + 3, \n        cellBounds.Width - (int)(cellBounds.Width * phi / 8), \n        cellBounds.Height - (int)(cellBounds.Height * phi / 4));\n\n        graphics.FillRectangle(new SolidBrush(Color.FromArgb(int.Parse(formattedValue.ToString()))), rc);\n        graphics.DrawRectangle(darkPen, rc);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\nI also derived a class from DataGridViewButtonColumn (ColorPickerColumn), but I didn't really override anything. Anyway, now that we've got a button that will display a colored rectangle, we can add a ColorPickerColumn to a DataGridView on a Form. The next step is to handle the CellContentClick event as Ward indicated.\n\nprivate void dataGridView1_CellContentClick(object sender, DataGridViewCellEventArgs e) {\n  //CDF: make sure we're on the right column. I used the name for this test.\n  if(dataGridView1.Columns[e.ColumnIndex].Name == \"ColorColumn\"){\n    ColorDialog dlg = new ColorDialog();\n    ColorPickerCell currentCell = dataGridView1[e.ColumnIndex, e.RowIndex] as ColorPickerCell;\n\n    if(dlg.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK){\n      if(currentCell != null){\n        currentCell.Color = dlg.Color;\n        this.Invalidate();\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\nSeems to do exactly what I want for now. Nice XD\n"},{"layout":"post","title":"Cheap Thrillz&#58; TortoiseSVN overlay icons in Windows Vista","date":"2008-01-02 01:55","author":"chrispelatari","comments":true,"categories":["professional_geek"],"slug":"2008-01-02-cheap_thrillz_tortoisesvn_overlay_icons_in_windows_vista","body":"\n\nStep1: install tortoisesvn.\n\nStep2: open file dialog in vs.net (2008 at least)\n\nStep3: XD\n\nupdate: looks like the tortoisesvn team brought back those nifty icon overlays in vista while I wasn't paying attention ;) Incedentally, there is an option to turn the icon overlays off in the open/save dialogs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n"},{"layout":"post","title":"Oh, she amazed me!","date":"2008-01-24 14:34","author":"chrispelatari","comments":true,"categories":["professional_geek"],"slug":"2008-01-24-oh_she_amazed_me","body":"Effing brilliant.\n"},{"layout":"post","title":"Bring it on!","date":"2008-02-05 15:30","author":"chrispelatari","comments":true,"categories":["professional_geek"],"slug":"2008-02-05-bring_it_on","body":"31\n \n"},{"layout":"post","title":"Error&#58; Could not open the requested SVN filesystem","date":"2008-02-20 16:46","author":"chrispelatari","comments":true,"categories":["subversion","svn","apache"],"slug":"2008-02-20-error_could_not_open_the_requested_svn_filesystem","body":"When trying to connect to a new subversion repository over apache 2.0 using subversion 1.4.5.

This is needed because\nsomewhere in the Action code, I am making a call into User.Identity.Name, which\nis supplied by HttpContext at runtime. Again, since this isn't available during\ntesting, I have to tell the controller how to find the fake httpcontext used\nthen.\n\nFor this project, I'm using simple hand-rolled stubs. Here is the code for\nTestControllerContext:\n\npublic class TestControllerContext : ControllerContext {\n  public override System.Web.HttpContextBase HttpContext {\n    get {\n      return new TestHttpContext();\n    }\n    set {\n      base.HttpContext = value;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ninstead of returning the runtime HttpContext (which doesn't exist, remember)\nI'm supplying another hand-rolled stub. Here is that code:\n\npublic class TestHttpContext : HttpContextBase {\n  public override System.Security.Principal.IPrincipal User {\n    get {\n      return new TestPrincipal();\n    }\n    set {\n      base.User = value;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nagain, same principal :) because I'm concerned about calling into User for\nthe Identity.Name property, I return another stub that implements IPrincipal.\nHere is that code:\n\npublic class TestPrincipal : IPrincipal{\n  public IIdentity Identity {\n    get { return new GenericIdentity(\"you@me.com\"); }\n  }\n  public bool IsInRole(string role) {\n    throw new NotImplementedException();\n  }\n}\n\nnow, when the controller code that was calling User.Identity.Name is tested,\nit will return the name you@me.com. Line 11 of\nthe test code above asserts the test passes because if an error occurred, I\nwould redisplay the form with errors shown using the View() method.

I got it from cygwin (package utils_linux*) and copied the getopt.exe to the bin folder. Also had to copy 4 more files from cygwin to the bin folder (cyggcc_s-1.dll, cygiconv-2.dll, cygintl-8.dll and cygwin1.dll).    Like I said in the beginning, this is a hacky solution but it did work for me.   I simply followed what they said and have gotten this working on a few windows 7 machines.

The for a cause part was for 5th ward dogs so we brought dog food for $10 off the $30 admission. So, helped some animals and got to wheel a little bit to boot.\n\nProbably the best part of Tx Off Road Ranch is the playground. You can tell someone has been out there quite a bit to make some fun sandstone obstacles. Plus, earlier in the day it wasn't that hot. (I ended up getting so overheated that I quite literally almost passed out. So I burnt out early.)\n\nOther than that, the park doesn't have that much to offer. They seem to have 2 trail levels there: 2 wheel drive easy and fucking impossible. It's the sandstone I think. On the only extreme trail they have there, all of the boulders look nice and stable, but try crawling up them and they shoot out from under your tires. No bueno.\n\nAfter trying a couple of the harder trails we went back for lunch and bullshittin. I helped someone get their JKU back in 2H, having recently replaced my transfer case shifter cable with an Advanced Adapters cable shifter upgrade because of the same flimsy plastic clip issue they suffered. Since I'd just done the upgrade I had become quite familiar with the mechanics of how the stock system comes and why it's a dumb design. I'm sure you could get away with buying the cheap plastic clips and replacing them for a while. The second one that broke on me caused me to go ahead and get the upgrade, personally.\n\nRight before lunch, but after we got back from the trails to the camping area, I let Ethan sorry, Chris Jr. drive the Jeep for the first time. I was fairly nervous but I didn't freak out, mainly because we would be going at very slow speeds in a vehicle that I have been building up for the past year and a half to be safe even in extreme conditions. I jacked the driver's seat up as far as it would go, pulled it really far forward and told him, \"Turn the ignition, and put her in Drive.\"\n\nYoung Christopher did very well for his first try! Hell, he did better than a lot of people I took my driving test with so many years ago in Alief. I had to first explain very explicitly how to operate the pedals, and I guided him around the camp area for a couple of laps. He was outstanding at taking direction and focused very hard on doing exactly what I was telling him to do. He even got kudos from Brian. I appreciated that, like a lot.\n\nVery proud dad, very hot day."},{"layout":"post","title":"Hi.","date":"2014-05-12 20:41","author":"chrispelatari","comments":true,"categories":["professional_geek"],"slug":"2014-05-12-hi","body":"Hello.

I feel that the framework has matured quite a bit and it seems like a logical tool to use for rapid, maintainable web development. The last push to go ahead and put some real work into this idea has come with the most recent updates to asp.net. I really like the idea of being able to hack asp.net sites on OS X, and I will see if a transition within .net is doable or desirable in the future. For now tho, if I have to learn a whole new paradigm I might as well learn a new framework while I'm at it. Routing is one area that seems more powerful in rails - mvc routing is very similar and probably as powerful. For now, I want to see how those dirty rails hippies live.\n\nIn my quest to learn rails, I needed a dual-boot environment to run alongside windows. I chose debian linux because it seems like it has access to most of the stuff that I need. Debian's installer was pretty impressive. It has a setup.exe that runs from within windows. At first I burned the CD incorrectly (just copied the iso) but after getting that sorted debian installed, put a grub loader in the mbr, and boom I was ready to roll.\n\nAfter double checking that the dual-boot installed properly, I needed a few tools.\n\nI started with Chromium for the default browser, and then found dropbox and keepass2 and installed those for some xplat love.\n\nAtom editor\ngit\nsudo\nrvm\nbundler\n\napt-get is the package manager on debian. Atom has a .deb package available for download. I got it installed with dpkg.\n\ndpkg -i atom-amd64.deb\n\nah, but that didn't install all the way. Looking at the logs told me that it was missing git. okay. here is where I started to run into permission problems, so I tried running sudo only to find it not installed by default. :(\n\nit did have su, so I ran under su:\n\napt-get install sudo\n\nnow I have sudo, but I'm not listed as a sudoer. So, still under su:\n\nvisudo\n\nand add the appropriate permissions.\n\nnow, I can install git.\n\nsudo apt-get install git\n\ngit is there. but atom still fails to install. apt-get to the rescue again:\n\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nand that solved it for me.\n\nNext, I needed rvm so I installed it using curl (also not available by default). rvm is very helpful in its messages, so after getting everything sorted there, and restarting the terminal, I could now install and execute bundler. I had to do a couple of extra steps to get postgresql installed locally, adding myself as a user with createdb access. But it worked. In one day.\n\nI now have windows 7, 10, OS X, and Debian linux installed and I use all of them for development.\n"},{"layout":"post","title":"switched engines again","description":"extended babbling about changing blog enginges for maybe the dozenth time.","category":"as-if-you-cared","tags":["blog"],"slug":"2015-10-07-switched-engines-again","body":"\nthis time from WordPress to jekyll.

It currently feels like 2008-2010 Twitter, when it was still fun and interesting.\nAnd not run by Elon Musk.\n\nIt was not an easy task, but I learned a lot along the way. I'm going to share my journey with you, and hopefully you'll find it useful.\n\nBase Environment : OS X\n\nI decided to use my MacBook instead of my Windows box or the Ubuntu Linux that I installed on a Mac Mini. I might change my mind later. I'm not sure yet. This was more of a proof of concept: can I even get all of the moving parts to work together? I'm not sure if I'll actually use this instance for anything other than testing and development.\n\nGuest Environment : VirtualBox\n\nI'm using VirtualBox as the virtualization provider for Vagrant with the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS box, which is a 64-bit version of Bionic Beaver.\n\nHost Environment : Vagrant\n\nI wanted to build this on my Mac, but I also wanted to be able to easily destroy and rebuild the environment if I needed to. So I decided to use Vagrant.\n\nVagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. It allows you to define a virtual machine configuration in a single file, and then spin up the virtual machine with a single command.\n\nI used homebrew to install it:\n    brew cask install vagrant\n\nI then created a new directory for my project, and created a new Vagrantfile in it:\n    mkdir vagrant\n    cd vagrant\n    vagrant init\n\nI then edited the Vagrantfile to use the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS box:\n    Vagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\n        config.vm.box = \"ubuntu/bionic64\"\n    end\n\nI customized the Vagrantfile a little more using the Vagrantfile for Mastodon as a reference.\n\nI started the virtual machine:\n    vagrant up\n\nI then SSH'd into it:\n    vagrant ssh\n\nInstalling Mastodon from Source\n\nI decided to install Mastodon from source, instead of using the Docker image. I wanted to learn more about the underlying technologies, and I wanted to be able to customize the installation. Also, I wanted to be able to use the latest version of Mastodon, instead of the version that was available in the Docker image. To accomplish this, I needed to install Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL.\n\nI started with the Mastodon Installation Guide. It took me a few tries to get it right, but I was able to get it working in the end.\n\nProbably the most difficult challenge was getting certbot to issue a certificate for my domain. I was able to get it working, but I had to use the --manual option, and I had to manually create the DNS records for the challenge. I'm not sure if there is a better way to do this, but it worked for me. I found a pretty decent guide at esc.sh that got me most of the way there. (see above)\n\nwebpacker woes\n\nWell now I have a working Mastodon instance, but webpacker is refusing to spin up, claiming that a service is already running on the port provided in the config file. This is my first time even looking at webpacker, having most of my experience in ASP.NET MVC. So I looked at the config/webpacker.yml file, and I noticed that the port was set to 3035. I looked at the nginx config file, and I noticed that the port was set to 3000. These aren't the same ports, what gives? This is usually the part of a blog post where I would say something like \"I spent hours trying to figure this out, but I finally figured it out.\" And I did. But I'm not going to bore you with how. This is already one of the longest blog posts I've ever written.\n\nI tried several different approaches and ended up having to restart the webpacker service a few times. Eventually it started working. I didn't take note of what was the winning magic incantation, but after a couple of restarts I have a working mastodon instance.\n\nIt lives!\n\nConclusion\n\nI don't fully understand how all of the pieces fit together yet, but I'm getting there. I'm going to continue to work on this project, and I'll update if I come across anything interesting.\n\nIt felt good to hack on something that gave me that feeling of accomplishment that I used to get when I was a young developer.
