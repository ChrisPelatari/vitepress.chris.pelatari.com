title: xhtml.xsd?

Where the heck do I get my grubby developer hands on 
this little beast if I can't browse, save in IE? My other browsers (Opera 
6.04/Mozilla 1.0) can't really handle it - opera just chokes and mozilla 
gives me a lot of text...maybe I could still save it as an xsd...I'll be 
back! 

**UPDATE:** You betcha. I browsed to [XHTML-STRICT](http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd) and 
selected 'save page as' in Mozilla - bam! I've got it on the Punisher(my dev 
box:)
